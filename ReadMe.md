<h1 id="rise-of-kingdoms">Rise of Kingdoms</h1>
<p>My project is Rise of Kingdoms. Webpage filled with information needed on this mobile game which has  been  released a little over year ago. Rise of Kingdoms is RTS  mobile  game. Featuring  many different commanders for armies, events,storyline. With  such in depth need  for information  I have decided to make a webpage  containing them.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>You can find  live demo of this project <a href="https://pajanec.github.io/rOK/index.html">here</a></p>
<h1 id="ux">UX</h1>
<p>This project focuses   both old users and has potential to  get new users into  the application. Most of users  have the same goal  to be  the best  they are able  to  be in this RTS mobile game. With  help of my project  they can achieve that  by  understanding basic principles  on how to develop commanders, how to organize strategy  for Lost Kingdom as well as see the rules  which are set in place,  how to win  the event  Ark of Osiris and see rules and basic information about event.</p>
<p>User story:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>As user  wants to  see full list of  commanders in the game, he<br>
needs    to open  page  of commanders and there is information<br>
written there    divided into categories of rarity. Also  there is<br>
additional    information how to better develop those commanders, as<br>
well as pictures provided with looks of commanders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic information  on   Lost Kingdom event are available once user<br>
goes to that page. From  basic explanation, to rules as to who  can<br>
participate and how as well as  map   of the area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also if user  need more information  on things not included in project or  needs a<br>
deeper understanding  of  certain information there is contact form<br>
under contact us  button, where  user needs to fill name, email and<br>
question.</p>
<p>I was using Balsamiq mockups3, recommended by my mentor.  To make a sketch of the idea that I had for my project. From how it would look to  where would text go and how many images,how many pages.<br>
This here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pFnGGzrFh2K1Roh2dxSjSalz2mJLvo2K?usp=sharing">link</a> where I have shared  the mock-up. Of course with going deeper into the  making of project itself  mock-up as such  has adapted  and developed  to better suit the need of the project itself.</p>
