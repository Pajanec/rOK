                <h2 class="glass">General</h2>


                <p class="para">The story begins with the murder of the Lord of Silence, Osiris, at the hands of his covetous brother, Seth. To ensure that Osiris would never return, Seth sealed his body in a coffin and threw it into the Nile. Iset, the wife of Osiris,
                    transformed herself into a bird and flew across Egypt, searching desperately for her husband’s body. After much hardship, Iset found what she was seeking. She constructed a temple in which she placed the Ark of Osiris, and began preparing
                    the reincarnation ritual that would restore him to life. Overcome with fury, Seth assembled a mighty army to seize the Ark and put an end to Iset’s plan.

                <h2 class="glass"> Rules</h2>
                <h3 class="steel">Alliance</h3>
                <p class="para">
                    Before the start of registration, alliances must have more than 10 alliance flags and must be ranked among the Top 20 alliances in the kingdom in terms of alliance power.</p>

                <h3 class="steel">Governor</h3>
                <p class="para">Governors must have joined the alliance and upgraded their city hall to Level 16 or higher before their alliance registers for the event. Governors who do not meet these requirements will be ineligible to be chosen as combatants.</p>


                <h2 class="glass">Other</h2>
                <h3 class="steel">Registration</h3>
                <p class="para"> Alliances ranked in the Top 20 in the Kingdom for alliance power can be registered by their alliance leader or titled officers. Governors who join an alliance after that alliance has registered for the Ark of Osiris battlegrounds cannot
                    be selected as combatants, and will not receive corresponding rewards. When registration closes, the list of combatants will be locked and no further changes will be allowed.</p>
                <h3 class="steel">Manage Army</h3>
                <p class="para">Alliance leaders and titled officers can head to the “Manage Army” page and select up to 30 vanguard combatants and 10 backup combatants to participate in the battle.</p>
                <h3 class="steel">Entering the Battlegrounds</h3>
                <p class="para">The Ark of Osiris battle takes place on a new map separated from the rest of the kingdom. Once the battlegrounds open, governors will need to ensure that all of their troops have returned to the city, no wounded troops are in their hospital,
                    and their city is not in a “War Frenzy” state.</p>
                <h3 class="steel">The Battle</h3>
                <p class="para">Upon entering the battlegrounds, the followers of Iset (Blue) will be transported to the upper left corner of the map, while the followers of Seth (Red) will be transported to the bottom right corner.
