            <h2 class="second-header">General Info</h2>
            <p class="main-paragraph-style">If you want to battle, you need a commander. Every commander has three specialities that determine which talent trees can be levelled. Every commander has four skills, which are unlocked according to the commander's star level. Epic and Legendary
                commanders have a 5th mastery skill that enhances o ne of their first four skills; it is unlocked by getting all four skills to level 5. Star levels can be unlocked by sacrificing sculptures, which are specific for that commander or are
                a general sculpture.</p>

            <h2 class="second-header">Tips</h2>
            <h3 class="third-header-style ">Always Get The First Skill To 5 Before Giving a Commander 2 Stars
            </h3>
            <ul>
            <li class="main-paragraph-style">Probably the most significant tip that a new player of Rise of Kingdoms can receive is to always increase your Commanders first skill to level 5 before letting them pass experience level 10. The Commanders in Rise of Kingdoms are an essential
                part to every Governors power level and strength in battle. As your Commanders gain experience their overall level begins to rise. Every tenth level that your Commander reaches, you will have to add stars to the commander to continue to
                upgrade the Commander. Adding stars also unlocks one of the Commanders Skills. The essential thing to do is to make sure that the Commanders first skill has reached the maximum level of 5, BEFORE you upgrade the commander past level 10.
                Do not use any stars on your commander until the fist skill has been set to level 5. This is because the first skill is the active skill and the most important. ​

          </ul>  <h3 class="third-header-style ">The Optimal Commander Pairings Will Increase Strength Significantly</h3>
           <ul> <li class="main-paragraph-style">In Rise of Kingdoms every Commander has strengths and weaknesses. Battles in RoK can be won or lost by selecting the correct Commanders. In Rise of Kingdoms your troops receive the strength bonus of both the Talent Tree, and the Skills of
                the Primary Commander. The army will only receive a bonus from the Secondary Commander Skills, not the talent tree. Matching the skills of the Secondary Commander with the Primary Commander can significantly increase an armies strength.

            </li>
           </ul> <h3 class="third-header-style ">Match Commanders With Their Optimum Army Troops </h3>
           <ul> <li class="main-paragraph-style">Most Commanders in Rise of Kingdoms have a specific troop type that they should command. The types of forces include calvary, infantry, and archers. Players should always check their Commanders for which of the troop types is optimal. By using
                a full march of only the Commanders specific troops you can increase the march speed, attack force, defensive strength, or health of the units depending on the Commanders Skills and Talent Trees. ​ There are also Commanders that are strengthened
                when they are leading an army of mixed troops. (i.e. Hannibal Barca) Players should always check their Commander skills and talent tree to see what type of troop they should be focused on building.</li>
            </ul><h3 class="third-header-style ">Create Presets For Your Armies Marches To Save Time During Battle
            </h3>
          <ul>  <li class="main-paragraph-style">For battles in Rise of Kingdoms speed is a crucial component. Every area that a Governor can improve their speed to respond to the battlefield should be taken advantage of. ​ This feature gives the player the ability to create the armies that
                the Governor is most likely to use again, and to save, and recall these armies for later use. This may seem trivial, but having your favorite armies saved under one of the 5 presets can make an enormous difference. ​ These presets are
                also extremely effective in the Rise of Kingdoms events like the Ark of Osiris. It provides the player the ability to switch between troop types quickly and effectively. Such as, switching between a fast marching army, and a hard hitting
                force. The presets are a crucial aspect that should be utilized by all players.</li></ul>
            <h3 class="third-header-style ">Pick The Right Civilization</h3>
          <ul>  <li class="main-paragraph-style">The first choice you have to make when starting Rise of Kingdoms is selecting a civilization. Each of selection provides players with a different initial commander, and also with a different selection of buffs and bonuses to receive during
                gameplay. Selecting the best civilization in Rise of Kingdoms, especially at the beginning will effect your kingdom throughout the game. By selecting the one that will provide the most benefit from the start will give you an edge over
                the competition.</li>
